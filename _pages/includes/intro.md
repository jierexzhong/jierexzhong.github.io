I am now a PhD candidate at [Faculty of Dentistry](https://facdent.hku.hk/), The University of Hong Kong.

I graduated from [China Pharmaceutical University](https://www.cpu.edu.cn/)(中国药科大学) with a bachelor's degree and from National Center for [Nanoscience and Technology](http://nanoctr.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences (中国科学院国家纳米科学中心) with a master's degree, advised by [Prof. Xing-Jie Liang (梁兴杰)](http://edu.nanoctr.cas.cn/zs/dsjs/swxy/202102/t20210225_5960617.html). I also collaborate with [Prof. Xinmiao Lan (兰新苗)](https://scbps.ccmu.edu.cn/szdw_7817/fjs_7820/f52de4d8cb9949acb598a0463a040720.htm) closely. 

My research interest includes novel biomaterials, biomedical engineering and supramolecular chemistry. Currently, I am deeply involved in specific projects related to advanced hydrogel system for mandible reconstruction for my PhD research.
