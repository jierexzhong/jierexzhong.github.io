I am now a PhD candidate at [Faculty of Dentistry](https://facdent.hku.hk/), The University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Richard Yu-Xiong Su](https://facdent.hku.hk/people/professoriate-staff/profile/richsu).

I graduated from [China Pharmaceutical University](https://www.cpu.edu.cn/) with a bachelor's degree and from [National Center for Nanoscience and Technology](http://nanoctr.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences with a master's degree, supervised by [Prof. Xing-Jie Liang](http://edu.nanoctr.cas.cn/zs/dsjs/swxy/202102/t20210225_5960617.html).

My research interests include novel biomaterials, biomedical engineering, supramolecular chemistry, etc. Currently, I am deeply involved in specific projects related to advanced hydrogel system for mandible reconstruction for my PhD research.I have published more than 10 papers in the top journals such as Biomaterials, Advanced Healthcare Materials, ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.
