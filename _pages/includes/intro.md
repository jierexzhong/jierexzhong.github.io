I am now a PhD candidate at [Faculty of Dentistry](https://facdent.hku.hk/), The University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. [Richard Yu-Xiong Su](https://facdent.hku.hk/people/professoriate-staff/profile/richsu).

I graduated from [China Pharmaceutical University](https://www.cpu.edu.cn/) with a bachelor's degree and from [National Center for Nanoscience and Technology](http://nanoctr.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences with a master's degree, advised by [Prof. Xing-Jie Liang (梁兴杰)](http://edu.nanoctr.cas.cn/zs/dsjs/swxy/202102/t20210225_5960617.html).

My research interest includes novel biomaterials, biomedical engineering and supramolecular chemistry. Currently, I am deeply involved in specific projects related to advanced hydrogel system for mandible reconstruction for my PhD research.
